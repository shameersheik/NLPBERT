Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps ""up"" button twice) next animation starts with ""jump"" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful. Here's the code: So must question is: how can I start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on (assuming that it was cancelled)? Or, in a simplier words, how can I determine current visible rect of a view?"

Will any of the alternatives cause grief in the longer run?,0,We're in the process of packaging combinations of our products/modules. Some of them are stand-alone some are interdependent. All versions must be deployable side-by-side. As it is we're considering two choices: One MSI per package and version One MSI per product/module and version The first alternative would mean that combinations of the same merge modules would be delivered in several packages. The second alternative represents the simpler path. Can you give some advice on the subject? Will any of the alternatives cause grief in the longer run?

Should I even worry about the memory/performance overhead of having a matrix of 96 objects?",0,"I've run into this problem a couple times now. Last time, I wanted to create an array of arrays (matrix) of BOOL's. I ended up encapsulating them in NSStrings, because apparently NSArray only has arrays of objects. This time, want an array of arrays again, but of CGPoints. I'm going to be using these to draw images to the screen. Is there a way to create an array of CGPoints without them being objects? Should I even worry about the memory/performance overhead of having a matrix of 96 objects?"
